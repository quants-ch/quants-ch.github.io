There's no super crazy design or features but all done with the static website generator "jekyll" which allows for quite dynamic content publishing from all sources that support markdown.

Since jekyll is github's default static website generator engine, everything now is nicely integrated with just a repo.

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll’s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll’s dedicated Help repository][jekyll-help].
